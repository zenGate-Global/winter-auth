## Credentials

The Credentials Module is an upcoming feature designed to enhance blockchain abstraction. Currently, with the sub-handles API still in development, users must manually mint credentials for the verification system via the handles.me panel. This involves creating a company handle and issuing sub-handles for each authorized field supervisor.

The planned release will introduce user-friendly, abstracted function calls, free from direct blockchain complexityâ€”to generate handles and mint sub-handles effortlessly.
